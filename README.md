# Weather-app

During my Prodigy internship, I built a Weather App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user input and displays temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed. I implemented error handling for invalid cities and ensured a user-friendly interface, showcasing my skills in API integration and responsive web design.
